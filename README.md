# Web Bot

Web Bot is a Python project that automatically detects and reports fake news and misinformation on social media platforms.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to improve the quality and credibility of information on the internet, and to empower users to make informed decisions.

## Features

Web Bot has the following main features:

- It can access and download data from various social media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit, using APIs or web scraping techniques.
- It can preprocess and tokenize the data, using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as cleaning, stemming, lemmatization, stop words removal, etc.
- It can classify the data as fake or real, using natural language processing and computer vision techniques, such as word embeddings, bag-of-words, TF-IDF, n-grams, sentiment analysis, image recognition, etc.
- It can train and evaluate a machine learning model that can perform the classification task, using various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, naive Bayes, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, or neural networks.
- It can deploy and test the machine learning model, using various methods and tools, such as AWS SageMaker Studio, AWS Lambda, AWS SNS, etc.
- It can monitor and update the machine learning model, using various metrics and techniques, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, cross-validation, grid search, hyperparameter tuning, A/B testing, etc.
- It can generate and send alerts or reports to users or authorities, based on the machine learning modelâ€™s predictions, using various formats and channels, such as email, SMS, web, etc.
